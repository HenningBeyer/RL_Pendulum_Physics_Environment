1. Jupyter kernel setup 
	conda create --name python_3.9 python==3.9 -y
	conda activate python_3.9

# Jupyter stuff (bare minimum to set up a kernel):
	pip install jupyter jupyterlab ipykernel ipython ipyparallel 
# Core Packages (for the kernel):
	pip install numpy pandas sympy scipy matplotlib dill lightning panel watchfiles pygments hvplot jupyter_bokeh pyviz-comms

# change your directory: cd H:\Next_Projects\RL_Pendulum
# install in editable mode for faster development:
	pip install -e .\rl_pendulum
	python -m ipykernel install --name python_3.9 --display-name "python_3.9" 


2. Jupyter Lab setup 
	## You will need Jupyter Lab 4.1.5 to avoid compatibility issues related to panel! ## Jupyter Lab 4.1.5 needs at least Python 3.8.5 ## make sure you are launching from the correct jupyter ## verify with: !jupyter lab --version --> 4.1.5 
	## To launch Jupyter Lab 4.1.5 (from Python 3.9+), you can simply change the Python PATH variable to target a newer python 3.9 version ## for example prioritize "C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39" over "C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36"
	## verify Python version again (outside the conda environment python_3.9): python --> 3.9+

# It is recommended to launch this Jupyter setup for all your private applications related to Python 3.9.5 (Jupyter 4.1.5 is faster and overall just more handy; extensions should not be conflicting)
# You can easily revert to your old Jupyter setup by proritizing, for example, your original Python 3.8 installation inside PATH (old Jupyter setups stay unaffected)
# It is not recommended to launch Jupyter from Anaconda environenments (One needs to type 2-3 commands every time to launch Jupyter which is annoying!), but this is possible
# Install these packages INSIDE or OUTSIDE the conda environment based on your preferences!
	# configure the new Jupyter Lab 4.1.5 via pip installs:
		pip install jupyter jupyterlab ipykernel ipython ipyparallel pyviz-comms panel plotly nbconvert playwright pyppeteer chromium 

# launch panel from your conda environment:
conda activate python_3.9
panel serve Example_Notebook.ipynb --show --autoreload
