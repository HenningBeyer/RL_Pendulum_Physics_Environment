# RL_Pendulum_Physics_Environment
This is a released packge of a mathematically simulated pendulum that can be flexibly adapted for applying it as an RL environment. An advantage of this pendulum simulation is the flexibility of the parameter definition, *including the number of rods*, the rod masses, rod inertias, and more.

Best view (this notebook)[https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uq41dUEIeIhEZbB_P_tdszrhBmdsofLk?usp=sharing] (the math renders more properly in JupyterLab) and review the overall clean code to get all the information you need. It is aimed to enable more flexible RL research on the difficult control problem of the cart-pendulum environment.

Credit: The very good math derivations of (this notebook)[https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tonlB7P0w4EZv2eC8PMP9zO-FzwBizb_] for the triple cart-pendulum were reused for this project and abstracted to an n-rodded cart-pendulum class.
